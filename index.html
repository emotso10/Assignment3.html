            Coconut oil is a popular edible oil and skincare product that is known for its versatility and a wide range of qualities. Here are some of the key qualities and benefits of coconut oil:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Smoke Point:</strong> Coconut oil has a high smoke point, around 350°F (175°C), making it suitable for cooking methods like frying and sautéing without breaking down into harmful compounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> It contains a unique combination of fatty acids, primarily saturated fats, with a high proportion of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). MCTs are considered healthier fats and are easily digestible.</li>
            <li><strong>Antimicrobial Properties:</strong> Coconut oil has natural antimicrobial and antibacterial properties due to the presence of lauric acid. This makes it useful for oral hygiene, as a skin ointment, and for combating infections.</li>
            <li><strong>Skin and Hair Care:</strong> Coconut oil is often used in skincare and haircare products due to its moisturizing and nourishing properties. It can help with dry skin, dandruff, and can be used as a natural moisturizer.</li>
        </ul>
